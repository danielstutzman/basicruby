    Hi everyone :-)
    In this lesson, I'll demonstrate how a method can take another
      method as an argument, and why you'd want that.
    We'll start by looking at some code that takes in an array,
      and adds one to each element.

    Okay, now imagine you were asked to change this code,
      so it can either add 1, or 2, to the array.
    The most obvious thing to do -
      is change the 1 here to the variable n (change),
      which now is a new parameter (change),
      that I have to pass in when I call add_1.
      And we'd want to rename add_1, to avoid confusion.

    So: nothing new so far...  so let's go back...
    And now imagine you were asked to change this code,
      so it can either add 1, or multiply by 2, to the array.
    Now the problem is - we need to somehow have a variable that
      contains either x + 1 or x * 2.
      Can we do that?  Can we just pass in x + 1 or x * 2 like this?
    Well no, that doesn't work because x isn't defined outside the method.
      Also the adding or multiplying is happening only once here,
      and we want it to happen three times, once for each number.

    We can get closer to the solution by making a new method,
      with just x + 1 inside it, call it plus1.
    Let's test it... okay it works.

    So now, how can we pass in this plus1 method, so that we can call it later?
      Can we just write plus1 here, and then call f here?  Almost.
    The problem is - just by mentioning the name plus1, we're calling it.
    Even if we leave off the parens, we still get an ArgumentError.
    We're stuck.

    So. There is a way to mention a method without immediately calling it,
      which is to call the "method" method, like this.  Now the variable f
      contains a Proc object, which we can call with the "call" method,
      like this.

    So let's rename add_1 to something more generic,
      since it's not only adding anymore; how about "repeat."
    Add we'll create a times2 method, and test it.

    Again, the repeat method here is taking a Proc object, and calling it,
      and that's an example of functional programming.

    def times2(x)
      x * 2
