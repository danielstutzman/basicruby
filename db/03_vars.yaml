    Hi everyone :-)
    In this lesson,
      we'll assign numbers to variables, then read them back.
    You notice the debugger now has a new section, for variables!
    So line 1 just creates a variable named x, with a value of 4.
    Line 2 changes the value of x, to 3.
    So line 3 will output the new value of x, which is 3.
    In line 4, we set the variable y to 5,
      but we never output y, so you won't see 5 in the output.
    Instead we output x again.
    Why?  So you can practice *really* looking at *details*,
      instead of guessing what a program will do.
