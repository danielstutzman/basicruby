    Hi everyone :-)
    In this lesson, we'll call the "put-s" method.
    "Put-s" outputs a number or a blank line.

    So the Ruby code is here at the left.
    And you'll run it by clicking Run...

    Or... by clicking Debug,
    so you can step through the program, line by line.

    Okay, your turn.
